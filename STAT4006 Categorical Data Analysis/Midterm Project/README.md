_**Project Specification**_
* Individual Project.
* Part I: To analyse CPS1985 data using a three-way table.
* Part II: To model 'wage' with other categorical variables using a GLM.

_**Thesis Statement**_
*  Part I: Sex Discrimination in the 1980s.
* Part II: Message to Students in Career Development.

_**Exclusive Summary for Part I**_
* Given 'sector', 'experience' and 'gender' as the targeted categorical variables.
* Hypothesise 'gender' has an effect on the type of industries and duration in the workforce.
* Simpson's Paradox exists while comparing the independence of work experience and types of industry.
* However, odds ratio suggests a weak association between work experience and types of industry.
* Thus, it is less likely to believe there is sex discrimination in the 1980s.

_**Exclusive Summary for Part II**_
* Perform model selection and pick 'education', 'age', 'occupation' and 'union' as the parsimonious model.
* Employ a cumulative logit model to analyse the data, which preserve the ordering in 'wage'.
* The fitted model suggests the higher the education level, the higher chance to earn more.
* The model says age does not affect the income.
* Management and technician are the common occupations to make more money.
* People who attend union will increase their chance to promote themselves in career.
* The above findings give students some advice to pursue their careers.
