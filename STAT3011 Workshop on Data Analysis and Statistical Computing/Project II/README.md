_**Project Specification**_
* Group Project.
* Implement statistical computing methods on some given questions.

_**Thesis Statement**_
* Statistical Computing Algorithms with R.

_**Individual Report**_
* An essay describes our understanding of several statistical computing topics.
* Topics: root finding, optimization, numerical integration, Monte Carlo integration.

_**Implementation on given questions**_
* Root finding: use bisection and Newton-Raphson algorithms to find the maximum value of an objective function.
* Optimization: programme a genetic algorithm to search the global maximum of an objective function.
* Numerical integration: apply quadrature and Monte Carlo methods to estimates the integral of an objective function.
* Monte Carlo integration: employ Monte Carlo integration to compute the correlation among variables within an objective function.
