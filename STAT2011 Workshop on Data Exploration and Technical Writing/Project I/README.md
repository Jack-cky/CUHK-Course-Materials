_**Project Specification**_
* Group Project.
* To design and implement an experiment with statistical findings.

_**Thesis Statement**_
* The Hygroscopic Capacity of Different Types of Paper.

_**Problem Statement**_
* The design of different types and brands of paper towels may be related to the hygroscopic capacity.
* We aim to compare different paper towels and test whether there are fixed effects on the hygroscopic capacity.

_**Motivation**_
* One of our members broke a cup of water and had to clean up the place.
* She took some amount of tissue paper to clean up the place.
* Therefore, we want to know which type of paper towel do the best in this situation.

_**Methodology**_
* Measure the pre-weight of a cup of water and place a piece of paper towel in the water.  
* Measure the weight loss after removing the paper towel from the water.

_**Data Analysis**_
* Utilise one-way ANOVA to verify the fixed effects.

_**Results**_
* One hundred and fifty testing paper towel were collected in the experiment.
* The means for both min pocket tissue (9.88g) and toilet paper (9.72g) were found to be equal.
* The amount of water absorption by kitchen paper (13.02g) is significantly greater among the other treatments.  

_**Conclusion**_
* The differences between different brands of paper towel are shown.
* Kitchen paper is recommended to clean up a place when you break a cup of water.
