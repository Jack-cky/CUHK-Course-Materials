_**Project Specification**_
* Group Project.
* To leverage the creativity and innovative thinking in the use of data science to help understand and fight COVID19.

_**Thesis Statement**_
*  Visualising COVID-19 and Classifying Severe Cases with Immediate Medical Needs.

_**Problem Statement**_
* Focus on the area of visualisation and prediction for COVID19 data.
* Visualize the overall trends and classify the issue of death from the novel coronavirus. 

_**Motivation**_
* "YOU STAY AT HOME FOR US" came to our minds so many times because of the tremendous pressure on the medical industry.
* We want to give doctors a hand on making a decision based on the urgency of patients from the novel coronavirus.
* We anticipate the outcome can assist professionals to decide a better judgement on healing the patients.

_**Methodology**_
* Grap streaming data from Twitter for some keywords to get a general concern about COVID19.
* Utilise line graph and linear regression model to investigate the trends and association of confirmed cases and death cases.
* Construct a decision tree to predict whether a confirmed patient would face potential death.
* Implement a k-means algorithm to classify a confirmed patient with similar characteristics in the symptom.

_**Conclusion**_
* The number of confirmed and death cases were still increasing.
* "Trump" appeared the most in the streaming data related to the COVID19.
* The association between the confirmed and death cases are positively correlated.
* The classification tree was able to accurately predict (84.51% in F-measure) the destiny of a confirmed patient.
* Older patients with a shorter confirmed date are classified as urgent and have immediate medical needs.
