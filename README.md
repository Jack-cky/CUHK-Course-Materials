# Repository for CUHK Course Materials

Hi, this is Jack, a statistic (Data Analytics) student from the CUHK.  
If you're looking for something good in your study, you come to the rigth place for SOURCES.  

In Chinese, there is an idiom which "前人種樹" means I love gardening.  
As a backup, I will share with you some of my works and official solutions related to courses in Data Analytics stream.  

**Note: my works and even official solutions are not 100% correct, please treat it as reference only.**  
**Note: my essay works are submitted to VeriGuide, please carefully use it.**  

IF you like this repository, please don't hesitate to smack the start button just like how you smack CUSIS' mother during the add-drop period.
