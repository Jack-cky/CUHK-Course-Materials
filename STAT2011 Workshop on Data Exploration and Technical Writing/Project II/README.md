_**Project Specification**_
* Individual Project.
* Perform Exploratory Data Analyses (EDA) to any chosen dataset.

_**Thesis Statement**_
* Exploratory Data Analysis on the Novel Coronavirus.

_**Data Source**_
* The novel coronavirus data.
* During the first half-year of 2020, the number of confirmed cases and deaths are growing exponentially.
* We aim to propose an EDA report to facilitate further study on the dataset.

_**Flow of the Report**_
* Perform data cleansing and data visualisation.
* Discover the top ten countries and regions that were facing the most severeness situation.
* Check the model assumptions to ensure proper use of modelling methods.

_**Conclusion**_
* Statistical dependency was found in the dataset.
* Nonparametric methods are recommended for analysing the data.
