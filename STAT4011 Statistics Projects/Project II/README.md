_**Project Specification**_
* Individual Project.
* Implement supervised learning models on two famous datasets.

_**Thesis Statement**_
* Data Analysis with Supervised Learning Algorithms.

_**Regression Problem on the House data**_
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the given data.
* Implement linear regression, lasso regression, partial least square regression and random forests models.
* Record the cross-validation error and prediction error of each model.
* Random forests perform the best, and partial least square regression is the worse scenario.

_**Classification Problem on the Titanic data**_
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the given data.
* Implement k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis and AdaBoost models.
* Record the cross-validation error and prediction error of each model.
* AdaBoost achieve the highest accuracy (80%) whereas logistic regression perform the worse (72%).
